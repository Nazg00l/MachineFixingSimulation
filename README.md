# MachineFixingSimulation

- This program will simulate the process of Machine fxinig 
  through a period of time with one Technican and 3 machines 
- Every machine finishes its repairing process after "5 units of time" since it enters the fixing state. 
- And the every machine automatically breaks after "10 units of time" 
- The "Time unit" here is simulated as "1 second"
- The initial values for each machine "break time" is hard coded here just for simplicity.
